    "Clearly state the question you will try to answer with your project. Your question should involve one or more random variables of interest, spread across two or more categories that are interesting to compare. For example, you could consider the annual maxima river flow at two different locations along a river, or perhaps gender diversity at different universities. Of the response variable, identify one location parameter (mean, median, quantile, etc.) and one scale parameter (standard deviation, inter-quartile range, etc.) that would be useful in answering your question. Justify your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE (Mar 1, 2022): If it doesn’t make sense to infer a scale parameter, you can choose another parameter, or choose a second variable altogether. Ultimately, we’re looking for a comprehensive inference analysis on one parameter spread across 2+ groups (with at least one hypothesis test), plus a bit more (such as an investigation on the variance, a quantile, or a different variable). In total, you should use both bootstrapping and asymptotics somewhere in your report at least once each. Also, your hypothesis test(s) need not be significant: it is perfectly fine to write a report claiming no significant findings (i.e. your p-value is large).\n",

Be sure to include at least two scientific publications that can help frame your study (you will need to include these in the References section).

    "With only about 8.3 percent of the population not being insured at any point in the past year, health insurance has a widespread impact on the American population (Keisler-Starkey & Bunch, 2022). With factors influencing insurance premius such as age, state and federal laws, and many more, there are many considerations insurance companies make to determine their prices. Many companies will also take insurance premiums out of employees pay to cover these costs, so it is important for employees to know the major contributors to their insurance costs, and the actions that can take to reduce them (Fontinelle, 2022). For this reason, we decided to explore if people who smoke are charged more for health insurance than those who do not in the United States, as this is one of few variables impacting insurance costs that people can actually control. Our population of interest is people in the United States who have health insurance policies. To answer our inferential question, we will calculate the mean difference between yearly insurance charges of smokers versus non smokers as our point estimate, using the null hypothesis that there is no difference in charges and the alternative hypothesis that charges are greater for smokers. Our data has been collected from the US Health Insurance Dataset and contains 1338 rows of data on peoples age, sex, smoking status (yes or no), insurance charges, and others."
